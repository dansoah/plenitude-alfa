# Plenitude Alfa

This is my former project, it was a school management system and my group and I did this as our high school final project. Actually it's an unfinished project, we decided to change all the project and create this three months before the due date, so, we presented just a big and cute web interface. At least we got the 9th place :)

Don't judge my by this code, like i said, it was my very first big project.

## Why are you sharing this code?

I know that it's unfinished and mostly crap code, but i feel proud about this project. It was my first attempt to do something big and it worked. This project will be here to remind me that I can always do whatever I want

## Can I use some part of your crap code?

Of course, my fellow developer. Just keep it open-source :)
