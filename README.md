# Plenitude Alfa

This is my former project, it was an school management system and my group and I did this as our high school final project. Actually it's an unfinished project, we decided to change all the project and create this three months before the due date, so, we presented just a big and cute web interface. Well at least we got the 9th place :)

Don't judge my by this code, like i said, it was my very first big project.
